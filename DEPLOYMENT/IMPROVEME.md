Let's update README.md:

1. Add my x.com: https://x.com/vladbortnik_dev

2. Add contact me: vladbortnik.dev/contact

3. (You have access to this dit as a part of your workspace): "/Users/vladbortnik/Desktop/screenshots/1.png: - this is a screenshot of github "About" Section. Search the web and provide up-to-date info: ( Oct 2025 ) and generate it. (All other images will be located in the same folder)

4. Explain the diff b/w "About #3" and "About me" in README.md. - I am interested in Personal Branding as a Software Engineer, Building Professional Social Network, SEO, and online presence/recognition.

5. Search the web and find up-to-date info: (Oct 2025 ) on best practices of adding a portfolio to github (and what are the main benefits if any). Also search for best practices of creating README.md files for regular projects: 
  -- Do in-depth extensive research on the web. Launch a few agents at once to make it faster. 
  -- Save your research for further use as a doc and best practices guide
  --Use 'sequential-thinking' tool to compare data from the web against my info. My goal is to find out the real info on how the Tech Job Market works and seeks for devs and chooses who to hire. How Tech companies gether data on potentially desired enployees, common ways they look for talents, (not general insructions everyone knows, but real facts, numbers and criterias). 
  -- Make a deep dinve-in and and come back only when your % of confidence will go above 90%. Then, create a report and put it into "archive/README-GUIDE.md" dir for me

6. After that: prepare a curated plan on how to improve/modify/write from scratch README.md using 'sequential-thinking' tool. Also, analyze Step #3 - it's closely related to improve visibility, searchability, etc.

7. Add to the list of connections my x.com account: https://x.com/vladbortnik_dev

8. Make UI (README Layout) more attractive. Take as an example my other project: https://github.com/vladbortnik/TLDRx/blob/main/README.md. Or find that file locally: "tldr-README.md"

9. Similar to that file put to the very top of README this image: "portfolio-for-readme-wide.png" = Title/Name/etc. 

10. Below that place all the technologies I used in all my projects with corresponding lebels and links to the docs.

11. And from here you will have to use 'sequential-thinking' tool to analyze each project: text, image(-s), layout, icons, text alighment, etc., compare them to guidelines from your research and revisite each part of the gitgub portfolio page. It seems to me that a page must cought an eye of a reader within 2-3 seconds: otherwise ppl will simply move on to the next.

12. Each link must look like a gem, like something you want to click on. Not simple underline, bold or italic, but the opportunity to attract a user. Check the following page as somewhat good example of RADME file: https://github.com/vLadbortnik/production-server-infrastructure/blob/main/README.md. Ot it's located localy: "infrastructure-README.md"

13. Project 1: -- Add more quantifiable information about my personal portfolio. I don't know what but I worked very hard, with close to zero knowledge on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. But I wrote 1000s lines of code and make the website look gorgeous (esp. for the guy who never did that before. -- HOWEVER: You should not mention that this is my first website, but search online and find ways to uphold my achievements. -- Use diff image than you use now. Use this one: "portfolio-for-readme.png"

14. Project 2: 
  -- Now, it also has a GitHub repo: "https://github.com/vladbortnik/production-server-infrastructure". Add the repo to README. 
  -- This diagram is the most important: "server-setup-diagram.webp" - place it in the beginning. But you don't have to make it page-wide - 25% from the left or the right side for the text will perfecr I think. 
  -- There is also "front" image: "server-setup-title-img-overlay.jpg" -  if you find space add this to the top ion Project2.
  -- you can place these 3 ssscreenshots at the very bottom. of this project But you should check first if all 3 images fit on 1 line next to each other. Otherwise, resise and make them look profeccionallly. Links to 3 files: "ssl-lab-test-score.png", "security-headers-score.png", "http-observatory-benchmark-score.png".
  -- Hey, does github README files allow any sorts of manipulation via CSS or JavaScript?? If yes, then definitely squeeze this image on top. Or you can make it lower in height: cut ~15% from top and 15% from the bottom - just make sure all words are visible.

15. Project 3. Same thing. Visual attraction, thought-thru layout, etc.

16. Project 4: -- Wrong favicon. Correct: "favicon.ico" -- the rest should fllow the samne guidelines

17. Project 5. Follow best practices.

18. Tech Stach: as I said before - move it above.

19. "BLOG" -- Make it sound "loud", really loud!!! That will be clear for everyone who sees that the developer (me) did not stop, but work constantly. -- Let it sound like "Is about to open". (Not "Coming soon"). - However, use appropriate words. Words, just like visuals, attract and engage. So, I rely on you - that the job will be done honestly and without generic/trained solutions.

20. Finally, do not forget to add my x.com accout and also "vladbortnik.dev/contact" as a CTA. (This time to the bottom)

21. Remake fotter. Search the most successful repos and find the most nicly styled. 


NOTE:

  -- This is long instructions. Use 'sequential-thinking' tool to simplify them. 
  -- And always perform web-search (October 2025).
  -- I am new to this job market and US culture and to this profession. So, I ask you to generate high quality content. It's crucial for me.
  -- You will also have access to 'playwrite mcp'. So, check how you code look like on the screen before calling me. - I have lots of things to do.
  -- You will have access to 'filesystem mcp' (they say that it is better for you, despite the fact you have access to the very same working dirrectory by default. So, I would appreciate a feedback from you - is filesystem mcp better or not)
  -- Brave MCP will help you with your research
  -- Remember; do not go to "/blog/" folder. Another Agent works there.
  -- Use 2-3 sub-agents whenever it's beneficial
