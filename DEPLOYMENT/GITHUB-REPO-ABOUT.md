## SEO & Discoverability Best Practices

### Why These Topics Matter
- **GitHub Search**: Topics improve discoverability in GitHub's search
- **Google Indexing**: Well-tagged repos rank better in search results
- **Recruiter Sourcing**: Technical recruiters search by technology keywords
- **Portfolio Visibility**: Topics appear in trending/explore sections

### Topic Selection Strategy
1. **Primary Technologies** (3-5): Main languages and frameworks
2. **Project Category** (2-3): Type of application (web-app, pwa, portfolio)
3. **Key Features** (2-3): Standout characteristics (security, performance, ai)
4. **Industry Keywords** (2-3): Recruiter search terms (devops, full-stack, backend)
5. **Location** (if relevant): new-york-city for local opportunity discovery

### Best Practices
- **Limit to 20 topics max** - GitHub truncates beyond that
- **Use lowercase with hyphens** - Standard convention
- **Include both broad and specific** - "web-development" AND "responsive-design"
- **Match job descriptions** - Use terms from target job postings
- **Update regularly** - Add new technologies as you use them
