3. Create redirect rule

**Pros:** Professional, memorable
**Cons:** Costs extra

# 🔐 Privacy Best Practices: Phone Numbers & Emails

## 📧 Email Privacy (What You're Already Doing)

### ❌ Don't Share Publicly:
```
contact.me@vladbortnik.dev
```

**Why Hide Email?**
- Spam bots scrape emails from websites
- Gets added to spam lists
- Phishing attempts
- Unsolicited marketing
- Email address sold to third parties

### ✅ Use Contact Form Instead:
```
https://vladbortnik.dev/contact.html
```

**Benefits:**
- Email stays completely hidden
- Built-in spam protection (CAPTCHA, honeypot, rate limiting)
- You control who can reach you
- Professional appearance
- Can track submissions

---

## 📱 Phone Number Privacy (Same Principles)

### ❌ Don't Share Publicly:

**Never put on:**
- Public websites
- GitHub profiles
- LinkedIn (use LinkedIn messaging instead)
- Twitter/X bios
- Public portfolios
- Email signatures for mass emails

### ✅ How Professionals Handle Phone Numbers in 2025:

#### **Option 1: Don't Share at All (Most Common)**

**Instead of phone number, use:**
- Contact form (what you have)
- LinkedIn messaging
- Email (after initial contact via form)
- Calendar scheduling links (Calendly, Cal.com)

**Example Professional Approach:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│ Contact Me                     │
│ ✉️  Contact Form               │
│ 💼 LinkedIn                    │
│ 📅 Schedule a call (Calendly)  │
│                                │
│ ❌ No phone number listed      │
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

#### **Option 2: Add Phone Field to Contact Form (Conditional)**

**Let THEM provide phone number, you call them back:**

Your contact form already has this:
```html
<input type="tel" name="phone" placeholder="Your phone number (optional)">
```

**Flow:**
1. Person fills out form
2. Includes their phone number
3. You decide if you want to call
4. Your number stays private

**Benefits:**
- Your number never public
- You control who you call
- Spam callers can't reach you
- Professional approach

---

#### **Option 3: Virtual/Secondary Phone Numbers**

If you MUST share a phone number publicly:

**Services That Provide "Burner" Numbers:**

1. **Google Voice** (USA only) - **FREE**
   - Get free virtual number
   - Forwards to your real phone
   - Can turn off anytime
   - Voicemail transcription
   - Spam filtering

4. **Hushed** - **$5-25/month**
   - Virtual numbers
   - International options

**How it works:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Public: (555) 123-4567 (Virtual)    │
│          ↓ Forwards to               │
│ Private: (Your Real Number) ←Hidden  │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Share virtual number on:**
- Business cards
- Websites
- Public profiles

**If spam gets too bad:**
- Change virtual number
- Your real number stays safe

---

### ❌ **Don't Do This:**

   ```
