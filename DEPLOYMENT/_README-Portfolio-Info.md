1. Potential clients and Recruiters/hiring managers.

2. You should merge the key highlights and the project that I created. Each project has its own area of expertise, tech stack, and each project shows different abilities that I possess. So I will now provide you with information for my project and GitHub README files where you will be able to get information about each project and make it relevant to be placed on the README file you are creating now.

Before you create the section with my projects and with the highlights of my skills, you have to ultrathink about structure and content of it.

In the end or at the appropriate place, you can add my GitHub, LinkedIn, and portfolio links with the appropriate badges or those little images that are common for README files on GitHub.

## Social Links

- Github: https://github.com/vladbortnik
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladbortnik
- Portfolio: https://vladbortnik.dev
- X.com: https://x.com/vladbortnik_dev

3. Images - provided above.

4. Blog. Yes, you should mention the blog. Just make a quick reference of this feature that is almost there. And refer to the "ReadMe" file inside of the blog folder: blog/README.md

5. Professional context. 

- Mentioned that I'm open for hire. Do not specify if I'm looking for a full-time job or gig job or something else. Just mention that I'm open for the jobs. I'll let people contact me through the LinkedIn. 

- Specific achievements: You should have been added it before in the projects section. 

6. Call-to-Action: Search online and find the best way to address this section, provided that I am looking for projects, gigs, jobs in general and personal branding. 

7. Tone: I believe it should be professional, somewhat formal, but friendly. Technical and detailed tones should be only in the section with projects and in those parts where it is appropriate.
