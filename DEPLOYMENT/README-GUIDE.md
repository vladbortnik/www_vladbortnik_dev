## The US Tech Job Market Reality (2025)

### Current State (October 2025)

The tech job market in 2025 presents a paradox: companies claim they can't find talent, yet engineers struggle to get responses. Here's the reality:

**Job Market Statistics:**
- Software development job postings **down 10.6%** from previous year
- Applications increased **45.5%** year-over-year
- One Y Combinator startup: **23,000 applications for 8 positions** in 30 days
- Traditional job applications yield **~10% of hires** at top companies

**What's Working:**
- AI/ML engineer roles: **60% of companies hiring** (up from 35% last year)
- Cybersecurity positions: growth across 300+ NYC companies
- Cloud architects: $150K-$240K range
- DevOps engineers: consistent demand

**What's Not:**
- Junior developer positions: **25% decrease** in new grad hiring at Big Tech
- Generic backend/frontend applications without specialization
- Candidates without online presence or portfolio
- Pure code-school graduates without demonstrated projects

### Layoffs and Recovery

**2024-2025 Layoffs:**
- **152,104 employees** laid off by 547 tech companies (2024)
- **89,964 employees** laid off by 204 companies (2025 YTD)
- **3,555+ companies** announced mass layoffs since Jan 1, 2025

**Recovery Signs:**
- **56% of tech managers** plan to add new permanent roles in 2025
- **60% hiring for AI engineer** positions
- **77% increasing contract talent** use
- Shift from "growth at all costs" to "profitable growth"

## The Hidden Job Market

### The 70% You're Missing

**Core Statistics:**
- **70-80% of jobs are never publicly posted** (multiple sources confirm)
- **85% of vacancies filled via referrals** (Novoresume 2025)
- **Referrals are 7x more likely to be hired** than cold applicants
- **Referred candidates hired 55% faster** (29 days vs 55 days)

### Why Companies Keep Jobs Hidden

1. **Avoid Application Floods**
   - Remote/tech positions attract hundreds to thousands of applicants
   - Quality deteriorates with volume
   - Recruiting teams overwhelmed

2. **Cost Savings**
   - Referrals reduce recruiting costs by **55%**
   - Lower time-to-hire means lower operational costs
   - Better retention rates (20% longer tenure)

3. **Quality Over Quantity**
   - **67% of recruiters** believe LinkedIn-sourced hires are higher quality
   - Internal promotions ensure cultural fit
   - Network hires have proven track records

### The Networking Statistics

**Power of Connections:**
- **80% of professionals** find networking essential to career success
- **39% of UK workers** found their job through their network
- **52.5% cited personal connections** as reason for latest promotion
- **70%+ were hired by companies** where they had a connection

**Recruiting Efficiency:**
- Recruiting via referrals is **47% quicker** than job boards
- **62% of companies reduced time-to-fill** with employee referrals
- **89% of hiring managers** say referrals are important

**The Truth About the "85%" Stat:**
The widely cited "85% of jobs filled through networking" is actually misleading—it came from a non-scientific LinkedIn survey where only ~11% actually said they found jobs through networking alone. However, the **70% hidden job market statistic is well-documented** across multiple recruiting industry sources.

6. **Numbers and metrics** - Quantifiable achievements stand out
