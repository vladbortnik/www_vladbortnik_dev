## ‚ùå PENDING TASKS (5 Major Sections)

### 2. About Section Improvements (0% Complete)

**Required Changes:**

#### 2A. Bio Update
**Current Bio (index.html, lines 169-175):**
```
"Software Engineer specializing in Python/Flask architectures and DevOps practices.
Successfully deployed multiple Production-Grade Web applications using Docker
containerization and Cloud Infrastructure..."
```

**Issues:**
- ‚ùå Only mentions backend (Python/Flask), ignores frontend expertise (React 19, Vite, Tailwind)
- ‚ùå Doesn't mention 3+ years experience
- ‚ùå No personality or storytelling
- ‚ùå Generic language

**Recommended Replacement (from TO-DO):**
```
"Software Engineer with 3+ years of hands-on experience building and deploying
production web applications across the full stack. Independently developed 5 live
applications using modern technologies including React 19, Python/Flask, Docker,
and cloud infrastructure, serving real users with 99%+ uptime..."
```

**Action Required:** Replace bio paragraph at lines 170-175

---

#### 2B. Aspirational Paragraph Update
**Current (lines 201-206):**
```
"I'm particularly drawn to roles that allow me to leverage my full-stack capabilities
while deepening my expertise in cloud architecture and infrastructure automation..."
```

**Issues:**
- ‚ùå Too vague and generic
- ‚ùå "Financial technology" - why specifically? Seems forced
- ‚ùå Template language

**Recommended Replacement (from TO-DO):**
```
"I thrive on turning ideas into production reality. My portfolio of 5 deployed
applications showcases end-to-end capabilities: modern frontend with React 19,
robust backend with Flask and PostgreSQL, secure Docker deployments, and A-rated
SSL implementations..."
```

**Action Required:** Replace paragraph at lines 201-206

---

#### 2C. Skills Section Additions
**Current Skills:** 10 skills (Python, Flask, DevOps, Docker, etc.)

**Missing:**
- ‚ùå React 19
- ‚ùå Vite
- ‚ùå Tailwind CSS
- ‚ùå Performance Optimization
- ‚ùå Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
- ‚ùå Bootstrap

**Action Required:** Add 4-6 new skills to balance columns (5-6 skills per column)

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes
**Priority:** High (shows modern stack)

---

### 3. Resume Section Corrections (0% Complete)

**Critical Issue:** Unverifiable claims appear 8+ times throughout resume

**Claims to Remove/Modify:**

#### 3A. Uptime Claims (4 instances)
**Locations:**
- Line 528 (Summary): "99.9% uptime"
- Line 640 (Experience): "99.9% uptime"
- Line 668 (Server Infrastructure): "99.9%+ uptime over 6+ months"
- Line 752 (Recipe App): "99.9% uptime"

**Problem:** Cannot verify without monitoring tools (Uptime Robot, New Relic, Datadog)

**Fix:** Remove or replace with "comprehensive monitoring" or "production-ready deployment"

---

#### 3B. Performance Metrics (1 instance)
**Location:** Line 528 (Summary)
```
"achieving 93.4% performance improvements through strategic optimizations"
```

**Problem:** Misleading - sounds like overall app performance, but actually refers to INP metric specifically

**Fix:** Change to "93% INP improvement" or "significant performance improvements"

---

#### 3C. User Count Claims (2 instances)
**Locations:**
- Line 528: "serving 500+ users"
- Line 640: "serving 500+ users"

**Problem:** Personal projects don't have verified user counts without analytics

#### 3D. Cost Savings Claims (2 instances)
**Locations:**
- Line 644: "70% cost savings ($12/month vs $50+/month)"
- Line 670: "Optimized infrastructure costs by 70%"

**Problem:** Comparing VPS ($12 DigitalOcean) to managed platforms ($50 Heroku) is apples-to-oranges

**Fix:** Change to "cost-optimized deployment ($12/month)" without percentage

---

#### 3E. Unmeasured Reduction Claims (1 instance)
**Location:** Line 753 (Recipe App)
```
"reducing signup friction by 70%"
```

**Problem:** Not measured via A/B testing or conversion analysis

**Fix:** Change to "streamlined signup process with OAuth 2.0"

---

**Total Resume Corrections Needed:** 10 instances across 8 different locations

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours (careful editing required)
**Priority:** **CRITICAL** - affects credibility in interviews

## üéì RECOMMENDATIONS

### Top 3 Priorities (Do This Week)
1. **Update Metrics** (5 min) - Quick credibility win
2. **Correct Resume Claims** (2-3 hrs) - Critical for employability
3. **Update Bio** (15 min) - Show modern full-stack capabilities

### Can Wait
- Technology Carousel Expansion (nice to have, but current 7 techs are core skills)
- Interests Section Replacement (aesthetic improvement, not critical)

### Decision Points Needed
Before proceeding with remaining tasks, decide:
1. Which Bio version to use (Option 1, 2, or 3)?
2. Carousel approach (JavaScript shared data or manual sync)?
3. Keep or remove floating button on server-setup.html?
