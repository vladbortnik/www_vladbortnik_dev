## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS (WITH SCREENSHOT PROOF)

### 1. Fixed Vertical Card Spacing (REAL FIX)

**Problem:** You were RIGHT - my 40px on `.blog-post-card` was being overridden by Bootstrap's column margin.

**Real Fix Applied:**
```css
/* Line 138-141 in blog.css */
.blog .row > [class*="col-"] {
  margin-bottom: 40px;
}
```

**Desktop:** 40px spacing  
**Mobile (768px):** 30px spacing  
**Mobile (576px):** 25px spacing

**Proof:**
- `screenshots/01-cards-spacing-desktop-fixed.png` - Clear 40px gaps visible between cards
- `screenshots/02-cards-spacing-mobile-fixed.png` - Proper 30px spacing on mobile

**Files Changed:**
- `/blog/assets/css/blog.css` (lines 138-141, 693-695, 717-719)
- `/blog/index.html` (CSS version bumped to v4)

---

### 2. Implemented Prism.js Syntax Highlighting

**What I Did:**
- Added Prism.js CDN with `prism-tomorrow` dark theme (matches your dark design)
- Added language-specific modules: Python, Docker, Nginx, Bash, JavaScript
- Applied to ALL 3 blog posts

**Proof:**
- `screenshots/05-prismjs-syntax-highlight.png` - Shows code with syntax colors

**Code Added to Each Post:**
```html
<!-- Prism.js for Syntax Highlighting -->
<link href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.29.0/themes/prism-tomorrow.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

<!-- At bottom before </body> -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.29.0/prism.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.29.0/components/prism-python.min.js"></script>
<!-- + Docker, Nginx, Bash, JavaScript as needed -->
```

**Files Changed:**
- `/blog/posts/docker-python-best-practices.html`
- `/blog/posts/flask-authentication-jwt.html`
- `/blog/posts/nginx-ssl-configuration.html`

---

### 3. Added Reading Progress Bar to ALL Posts

**What I Did:**
- Added `<div class="reading-progress"></div>` after `<body>` tag
- Added `blog.js?v=2` script reference for scroll tracking
- Progress bar shows green gradient at top as you scroll

**Proof:**
- `screenshots/04-progress-bar-working.png` - Green gradient bar at top of page visible during scroll

**Code Added:**
```html
<body>
    <!-- Reading Progress Bar -->
    <div class="reading-progress"></div>
```

**Files Changed:**
- `/blog/posts/docker-python-best-practices.html`
- `/blog/posts/flask-authentication-jwt.html`
- `/blog/posts/nginx-ssl-configuration.html`

---

### 4. Fixed Mobile Footer Layout

**Problem:** Footer had too much empty space and poor layout.

**What I Did:**
- Reduced padding: 30px ‚Üí 25px on tablet, 20px on mobile
- Changed grid to stacked vertical layout on mobile
- Links now stack vertically with 12px gaps
- Social icons reduced: 36px ‚Üí 32px on small mobile
- All links left-aligned for better readability

**Proof:**
- `screenshots/03-footer-mobile-current.png` - Shows current footer state

**Files Changed:**
- `/blog/assets/css/blog.css` (lines 692-714, 739-747)

## üéØ Kent C. Dodds Blog Research

**Card Hover:**
- Subtle elevation increase
- Shadow becomes more prominent
- No zoom on card itself, only on image inside

**Hero Section:**

**Blog Layout:**
