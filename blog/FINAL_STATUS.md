## 🎯 WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE (30 minutes)

### Update 3 Blog Post Files

For each file (docker, flask, nginx), add these 3 things:

**1. Add progress bar** (after `<body>` tag):
```html
<body>
    <div class="reading-progress"></div>
```

**2. Add social share** (before comments section):
```html
<!-- Social Share -->
<div class="social-share">
    <h4>Share this article</h4>
    <div class="share-buttons">
        <a href="#" class="share-btn twitter">
            <i class="bi bi-twitter"></i> Share on Twitter
        </a>
        <a href="#" class="share-btn linkedin">
            <i class="bi bi-linkedin"></i> Share on LinkedIn
        </a>
        <a href="#" class="share-btn copy">
            <i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i> Copy Link
        </a>
    </div>
</div>

<!-- Comments Section -->
<div class="comments-section">
```

**3. Replace footer** with enhanced version from index.html (lines 126-155)

**4. Add blog.js** (after bootstrap, before main.js):
```html
<script src="../../assets/vendor/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
<script src="../assets/js/blog.js?v=2"></script>
<script src="../../assets/js/main.js"></script>
```
